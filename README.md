pySHRA is an open-source package for simulating the Second Harmonic Rotational Anisotropy (SHRA) of an interface of interest. SHRA is an optical technique which involves measuring the SH response of a sample under azimuthal rotation while polarizer and analyzer remain fixed in the laboratory frame. In terms of its linear optical properties, the sample may be isotropic (scalar $\epsilon$) or uniaxial ($\epsilon_{o}$, $\epsilon_{e}$) in nature. The incident medium is assumed to have isotropic linear optical properties (e.g., air, water). pySHRA uses a Green function based approach to calculate SH electric field amplitudes originating from two sources of optical nonlinearities at the sample interface: (1) a 2nd-order surface susceptibility tensor $\chi^{(2)}(2\omega;\omega,\omega)$, and (2) a third-order susceptibility tensor $\chi^{(3)}(2\omega;\omega,\omega,0)$ belonging to the incident medium. pySHRA was designed to facilitate analysis of SH from electrode-electrolyte interfaces formed from two centrosymmetric media. At present, pySHRA does not consider other nonlinearities such as electric quadrupole or magnetic dipole effects, or $\chi^{(3)}(2\omega;\omega,\omega,0)$ of the sample. 

The input parameters of pySHRA are: (1) the frequency of the fundamental $\omega$, (2) angle of incidence, (3) dielectric constants of the sample at $\omega$ and $2\omega$ (may be complex-valued), (4) dielectric constants of the incident medium at $\omega$ and $2\omega$, (5) the crystallographic point group of the sample surface. pySHRA was originally designed to model SHRA of single-crystal samples prepared by epitaxial growth of a thin overlayer on a single-crystal substrate. For this use case, the dielectric constants of the substrate must also be supplied in order to correct the top surface reflection/transmission coefficients for internal reflections occurring at the film-substrate interface.

We highlight three major applications of pySHRA: (1) simulation of the azimuthal dependence of individual $\chi^{(2)}$ or $\chi^{(3)}$ elements, (2) calculation of the Fresnel coefficients that prefactor the $\chi^{(2)}$ or $\chi^{(3)}$ elements, and (3) performing a fit of  $\chi^{(2)}$ elements using experimental SHRA data.
